# Hi! I'm Edlyn. #


### Currently, I'm: ###
- working on an online store to sell copies of my new book, *Prompt IRL*. 
- maintaining *Prompt*, an online community project that explores how people can communicate on the Internet 
- looking to collaborate with other people on freelance projects. Maybe it's a project that requires someone one or two days a week at your startup. Or maybe it's a short-term project that takes a few months to execute. If you're interested in exploring ways we can work together, send me an email. 

### My goals for 2017 are to: ###
- learn how to make better prototypes, & iterate on them faster
- explore eCommerce and how products spread through ads & social networks
- document publicly what I observe and what I learn

### In 2016, I: ###
- worked for Basecamp in growth marketing, ran different marketing experiments, and reported to their COO
- ran a succesful Kickstarter campaign to fund *Prompt IRL*, a writing journal / anthology featuring stories from Prompt
- collaborated with Molly McLeod to design and publish the book!
- introduced 3x more people to Prompt
- was featured on CNN for my work with Coss Marte, who's become a very successful entrepreneur after being formerly incarcerated. I met Coss in 2013 through Defy Ventures, where I'd started volunteering after leaving my job in venture capital. He's the definition of hard working.
